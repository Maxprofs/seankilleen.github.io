File this under [VS Code Can do That?!](https://vscodecandothat.com/)

Sometimes I need to watch a log file or other file for changes, whether it be on my local machine or a remote server. On windows this can be a bit of a pain, and you oftentimes have to dump out of your IDE to make it happen.

So on a whim one day, I said "I wonder if VS Code can do that". I search the extensions, and lo and behold, VS Code *can* do that!

## Enter VS Code and the Log Viewer Extension

* Open VS Code
* Click on the `Extensions` button
* Type `Log Viewer` in the search box
