What a year, what a year! So much was packed into 2017 that for the first time I felt like a recap post actually makes sense, if only so I can keep it all straight.

## Speaking & Writing

* My first national conference talk
* 5 other talks: Akka.NET, ElasticSearch, Intro to OSS: https://seankilleen.com/Presentations/
* Blog posts on Jekyll, .NET Fringe, The S3 Outage, ICAgile, and avoiding primitive obsession in configuration.
* Did a fun presentation, "the dev-inci code", to help our BAs &amp; devs better understand each other.

## Work Stuff

* I became a .NET Xpert!
* Successful launch of a gigantic legacy modernization:
* Co-taught several Agile Engineering courses (CSD)
* Created a screencast for CSD
* Twilio forwarding
* Introduced &amp; Used structured logging with great success
* TechLadies happy hour meet up
* Started (and finished) the Dear Agile blog series experiment
* Creating & launching xluh.co
* Introduced razor templating for e-mails
* Co-authoring an ICAgile-certified testing & automation course
* Neo4j training

## Personal Stuff
I try not to be too personal on this blog as it's mostly tech, but there are some things I just had to mention. I'll keep it brief. :)

* **I got engaged!** In March, I took a trip to Key West with the love of my life and asked her to marry me. She said yes. It was awesome.
* **I got married!** Because we're crazy people, we decided "why wait to plan this wedding? Let's just do it!" And so, on November 3rd, Amanda and I tied the knot. It was hands down the best day of my life, and everything that I wanted it to be.
* **Politics**: Politics was a dumpster fire in 2017. So much has happened to our country in the last 12 months that genuinely worries me about the future and tests my optimism on a daily basis. In 2018 I want to work to help more people through these times, particularly those who aren't afforded my many & varied privileges.

## What's Next?
This is one of my favorite questions of all time.

* A Focus on Focus.
* Talks coming up in 2018: https://seankilleen.com/Presentations/
* More writing
* More OSS
