What a year, what a year! So much was packed into 2017 that for the first time I felt like a recap post actually makes sense, if only so I can keep it all straight.

## Speaking & Writing

* **My first national conference talk**: This year I was [selected to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFDXNGFvcYg) at [.NET Fringe](http://dotnetfringe.org), one of my favorite conferences of all time. It was a privilege and a thrill.
* **More talks**: I gave [5 other talks](https://seankilleen.com/Presentations/) to various groups on subjects including Akka.NET, ElasticSearch, and an introduction to OSS. Also, did a fun presentation with my talented colleague Dan Davis called "The Dev-inci Code", to help our Excella BAs &amp; devs better understand each other.
* **Blog posts** on Jekyll, .NET Fringe, The S3 Outage, ICAgile, and avoiding primitive obsession in configuration. I'd like to write more, but with the rest of this year, I'll forgive myself.

## Work Stuff

* **Successful launch of a gigantic legacy modernization**: Over the past year, I've been lucky enough to be the technical lead on the best team for a really challenging project. This project was a big bang modernization effort (not our choice) that replaced a mainframe system responsible for managing more than $7 billion in pension funds. In August, all 2.5 million lines of code went live, with no major issues! We've since done 6 or 7 feature releases with no issues as well. By far one of the biggest accomplishments of my career.
* **I became a .NET Xpert!** Excella has a great program to reward employees that continuously commit to making an impact beyond our client sites. The gist is that every 6 months I do a certain amount (or more) of activities against a "points system", such as writing, speaking, OSS work, etc. Because of that, I am now afforded 20% time -- 1 day per week that is now my own to contribute more widely to Excella and beyond. It's a great honor to be a part of their services leadership.
* **TechLadies happy hour**: I'm a big fan of [Allison Esposito](https://twitter.com/allisonveronica) and the work she's doing with [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com). It's crucially important to get more women into thi field -- we desperately need their talent & diversity of thought. 

I also: 

* Co-taught several Agile Engineering courses (where students can earn their CSD certification after passing an assessment)
* Created a screencast walk-through for one of our Agile Engineering course assessments for those who have trouble with it.
* Twilio forwarding
* Introduced &amp; Used structured logging with great success
* Started (and finished) the Dear Agile blog series experiment
* Creating & launching xluh.co
* Introduced razor templating for e-mails
* Co-authoring an ICAgile-certified testing & automation course
* Neo4j training

## Personal Stuff

I try not to be too personal on this blog as it's mostly tech, but there are some things I just had to mention. I'll keep it brief. :)

* **I got engaged!** In March, I took a trip to Key West with the love of my life and asked her to marry me. She said yes. It was awesome.
* **I got married!** Because we're crazy people, we decided "why wait to plan this wedding? Let's just do it!" And so, on November 3rd, Amanda and I tied the knot. It was hands down the best day of my life, and everything that I wanted it to be.
* **Politics**: Politics was a dumpster fire in 2017. So much has happened to our country in the last 12 months that genuinely worries me about the future and tests my optimism on a daily basis. In 2018 I want to work to help more people through these times, particularly those who aren't afforded my many & varied privileges.

## Random Blog Stats

* This year, I had 86,410 page views on the blog as of the time of this writing. That's a great feeling!
* 8 of the top 10 blog posts are specific "how to" articles, which tells me they probably had good SEO, and that if I need a quick how-to, probably lots of other people do as well.
* All of my top 10 blog posts were written over 1.5 years ago. Working on some fresh content is probably a good idea.

## What's Next?

This is one of my favorite questions of all time.

* A Focus on Focus.
* Talks coming up in 2018: https://seankilleen.com/Presentations/
* More writing
* More OSS
