What a year, what a year! So much was packed into 2017 that for the first time I felt like a recap post actually makes sense, if only so I can keep it all straight.

## Speaking & Writing

* **My first national conference talk**: This year I was [selected to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFDXNGFvcYg) at [.NET Fringe](http://dotnetfringe.org), one of my favorite conferences of all time. It was a privilege and a thrill.
* **More talks**: I gave [5 other talks](https://seankilleen.com/Presentations/) to various groups on subjects including Akka.NET, ElasticSearch, and an introduction to OSS. Also, did a fun presentation with my talented colleague Dan Davis called "The Dev-inci Code", to help our Excella BAs &amp; devs better understand each other.
* **Blog posts** on Jekyll, .NET Fringe, The S3 Outage, ICAgile, and avoiding primitive obsession in configuration. I'd like to write more, but with the rest of this year, I'll forgive myself.

## Work Stuff

* I became a .NET Xpert!
* Successful launch of a gigantic legacy modernization:
* Co-taught several Agile Engineering courses (CSD)
* Created a screencast for CSD
* Twilio forwarding
* Introduced &amp; Used structured logging with great success
* TechLadies happy hour meet up
* Started (and finished) the Dear Agile blog series experiment
* Creating & launching xluh.co
* Introduced razor templating for e-mails
* Co-authoring an ICAgile-certified testing & automation course
* Neo4j training

## Personal Stuff
I try not to be too personal on this blog as it's mostly tech, but there are some things I just had to mention. I'll keep it brief. :)

* **I got engaged!** In March, I took a trip to Key West with the love of my life and asked her to marry me. She said yes. It was awesome.
* **I got married!** Because we're crazy people, we decided "why wait to plan this wedding? Let's just do it!" And so, on November 3rd, Amanda and I tied the knot. It was hands down the best day of my life, and everything that I wanted it to be.
* **Politics**: Politics was a dumpster fire in 2017. So much has happened to our country in the last 12 months that genuinely worries me about the future and tests my optimism on a daily basis. In 2018 I want to work to help more people through these times, particularly those who aren't afforded my many & varied privileges.

## Random Blog Stats

* This year, I had 86,410 page views on the blog as of the time of this writing. That's a great feeling!
* 8 of the top 10 blog posts are specific "how to" articles, which tells me they probably had good SEO, and that if I need a quick how-to, probably lots of other people do as well.
* All of my top 10 blog posts were written over 1.5 years ago. Working on some fresh content is probably a good idea.

## What's Next?
This is one of my favorite questions of all time.

* A Focus on Focus.
* Talks coming up in 2018: https://seankilleen.com/Presentations/
* More writing
* More OSS
