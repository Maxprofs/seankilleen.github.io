I'm very excited to release a talk that had been percolating in my head for a bit and that I am grateful to have the opportunity to share with the world via the [.NET Fringe Conference](http://dotnetfringe.org) earlier this week.

You can watch the talk, embedded below: 



## Questions? Thoughts? Ideas?
I'd love to hear your feedback on the talk, especially if there's something you don't agree with or think could be improved. Feel free to respond here or on the [AWider.NET Github Site](http://github.com/AWiderDotNet/AWiderDotNet.github.io)
